# Kickstarter Data Science Project
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding website that allows creators to create fundraising campaigns to fund startups, products, and projects to help them become a reality. Each campaign have many factors that can influence how likely they are to successfully reach their target fundraising goal. This project investigated these factors to determine the best predictors of a campaigns's success.

Research Question: What relationships (if any) exist between the predictors (category of project, campaign goal, duration of project, original currency type) and the success of a Kickstarter project?
- What is the relationship between the category of the campaign and the average campaign goals for each category, by success vs failed projects? Are the two correlated with one another, and which influence success more? 
  - Which category has the highest number of successful campaigns?
  - Which year has the most projects that were successful?
  - Is there a optimal project duration to optimize chances of success?
- How do projects' success rates compare considering the projects' orignal currencies? 
  - Which currencies have the highest success rate and which categories have the lowest success rate? Are these success rates significantly higher and/or lower than campaigns that use other currencies?
